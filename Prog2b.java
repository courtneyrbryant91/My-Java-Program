 * Created August 31, 2008
 * Description: This program is used to teach how to use escape sequences to form a tab within a document.
 * What I learned:  I learned what the symbol for tab is.  I had trouble with aligning the lines that contained the zeros with the lines that had only tabs.  I had to delete some of the periods to make them line up correctly.
